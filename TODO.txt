	
- Squads:
	- Adjust squad numbers after dying
	- Do not assign bunker-marines to squad - bunker logic offline for the moment
	- medic: stay back
- Unit production: importance of training units
- Defense request expire
- Improve builder behaviour: Sometimes builder derps out
	- Ask units to move out of the way?
	- Builder destroyed: free resources
- SCOUTING..
	- pathfinding, avoid enemies
- Terrain analyze, identify chokes, gating... walling
	- Naturalchoke identify
- Militia
	- 6-pool should be repelled, better fighting logic
	- Proper deassignment
- Base/expansion management

Adaptive strategy
	- Adjust worker numbers after condition: 1/3 rule?
- Neural network: Modifies build order dynamically, alters squad composition, and targeting
- Unit target numbers: priority to different units?
