- SCOUTING..
- Improve build algorithm:
	- Reserve default comsat space(s)?
- Terrain analyze, identify chokes, gating... walling
	- Naturalchoke identify
- Scan
	- cooldown, keep track of scanned tiles

- WorkerManager 
 	- IDLE builder reassign
 	- SCOUT
 	
- MILITIA:
	- when no threat present, stop
	- lowest hp instead of nearest
- Adjust targetworkers after condition

- Building algorithm: exact place, around some spot
- Base/expansion management

- Neural network: Modifies build order dynamically, alters squad composition, and targeting
- Squads:
